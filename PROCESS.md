# Process Book
## Week 1
### Monday 30-11-2020
Project start
- Made Design document.
- Added all needed basic files; folders, templates, settings, urls.py, views.py.
- Set up everything the same way as we did in previous assignments.

### Tuesday 01-12-2020
- Restarted with the document because there was something wrong with the migrations; after 1 hour of trying to fix it I decided to just restart since it costs only 15 minutes to recreate the basic folders.
- Created models file.
- Created basic front-end with the General information connected to the CoinGecko API. 
- Added JS login pop-up screen. Currently trying to connect it with Django views. Error message still not working.

In your process book, you chronicle your big decisions. When faced with a decision during the day, document it like this:

The choice youâ€™ve made
What you expect to happen as a result of that choice (at this moment in time)
Why you expect things to pan out that way
