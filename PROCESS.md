Project start

- Set up everything the same way as we did in previous assignments.

### Tuesday 01-12-2020

In your process book, you chronicle your big decisions. When faced with a decision during the day, document it like this:

The choice youâ€™ve made
What you expect to happen as a result of that choice (at this moment in time)
Why you expect things to pan out that way
